# Media Player
Media player application for haiku.

### What
This is a replacement of current haiku Media Player, initialized in version 2.0.0 with hope this is would be good replacement ever.

### Why
Haiku currently has no open source music manager or jukebox application. A music manager that takes advantage of Haiku's unique attribute system to sort and filter songs would be very powerful.
